# Weather-Application
I use the service worker implementation of the Angular framework to build a PWA that displays the weather of a city using the OpenWeather API. Angula level: medium. It's a lesson from book : Angular projects (https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Angular-Projects-Second-Edition).
