# Weather-Application
I use the service worker implementation of the Angular framework to build a PWA that displays the weather of a city using the OpenWeather API. 
In this project, I build a PWA application to display the weather conditions of a city.
Initially, I learn how to con"gure the OpenWeather API, which I use to get
weather data. I then learn how to use the API to display weather information in an
Angular component. I see how to convert our Angular application into PWA using
a service worker. I also implement a noti"cation mechanism for our application
updates. Finally, I deploy our PWA application into the Firebase hosting provider.
Angular level: medium. It's a lesson from book : Angular projects (https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Angular-Projects-Second-Edition).
